    authoritative-only DNS server. This repository is intended to be used by
    the "ansible-pull" command from a nameserver host (see WARNING above).

    USAGE

    From a nameserver host, simply execute:

        "ansible-pull -d /var/lib/ansible/local -U https://github.com/monokal/ansible-nsd.git"
